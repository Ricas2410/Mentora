# Counting Numbers 1-20

## Numbers in Order
Let's learn to count from 1 to 20:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

## Number Words
- 1 = one
- 2 = two  
- 3 = three
- 4 = four
- 5 = five
- 10 = ten
- 20 = twenty

## Practice
Count objects around you:
- How many fingers do you have?
- How many toes do you have?
- Count the chairs in your room!

# Reading Comprehension

## What is Reading Comprehension?
Reading comprehension means understanding what you read. It's not just saying the words - it's knowing what the story or text is about!

## Tips for Better Reading:
1. **Read slowly** - Don't rush!
2. **Think about the story** - What is happening?
3. **Ask questions** - Who? What? Where? When? Why?
4. **Picture it in your mind** - Imagine the story like a movie
5. **Read it again** if you don't understand

## Practice Story
**The Little Cat**

Mimi is a small black cat. She lives in a big house with her family. Every morning, Mimi likes to sit by the window and watch the birds. She dreams of playing with them in the garden.

### Questions:
- What is the cat's name?
- What color is the cat?
- Where does she like to sit?
- What does she watch?

## Remember
Good readers think about what they read!

# Addition and Subtraction

## Addition (+)
Addition means putting numbers together to make a bigger number.
- We use the **+** sign for addition
- The answer is called the **sum**

### Examples:
- 5 + 3 = 8
- 12 + 6 = 18
- 25 + 14 = 39

## Subtraction (-)
Subtraction means taking away numbers to make a smaller number.
- We use the **-** sign for subtraction  
- The answer is called the **difference**

### Examples:
- 8 - 3 = 5
- 15 - 7 = 8
- 30 - 12 = 18

## Tips for Adding:
1. Start with the bigger number
2. Count up from there
3. Use your fingers if needed!

## Tips for Subtracting:
1. Start with the first number
2. Count backwards
3. Think: "What do I need to add to get the first number?"

## Practice
Try these problems:
- 14 + 5 = ?
- 20 - 8 = ?
- 16 + 13 = ?
