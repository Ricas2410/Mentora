üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack
Area	Tool/Language
Frontend	HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Bootstrap for UI)
Backend	Python + Flask
Templating	Jinja2 (for dynamic HTML pages)
Document Parsing	PyMuPDF, python-docx, pdfplumber
Database	SQLite (can scale to PostgreSQL later)
Authentication	Flask-Login (for admin login)
AI Question Generation	

Primary: Admin manually generates (if no API key available)

Optional Fallback: Plug in OpenAI, Cohere, or free-tier APIs later using a config file
| Hosting | Replit (All-in-one dev + hosting environment) |

üß† Intelligence Logic (AI or Manual)
If no AI API key is set: system uses admin backend for manual generation.

If a free or paid API key is added: user requests are processed by GPT or Cohere to generate questions automatically based on selected parameters.

Questions should match type, difficulty, and user instructions.

Admin can edit or filter generated questions before publishing (if moderation is enabled).

üîí Fallback Plan
Scenario	What Happens
No API key available	Admin generates questions manually
API quota exceeded	Notify admin, system switches to manual
Upload failure	Show friendly error + retry button
High traffic	Queue requests or scale later to Render or VPS
