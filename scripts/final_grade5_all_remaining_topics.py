## Spelling Patterns and Rules

### Common Spelling Rules
1. **I before E rule:** "i" before "e" except after "c"
   - believe, achieve, receive, ceiling
   - Exceptions: weird, their, height

2. **Silent E rule:** Silent "e" makes vowels say their name
   - cap → cape, bit → bite, hop → hope

3. **Doubling rule:** Double the consonant when adding -ing or -ed
   - run → running, hop → hopping, stop → stopped

### Phonics Patterns
- **Long vowel sounds:** a_e (cake), i_e (bike), o_e (home)
- **Short vowel sounds:** cat, bed, sit, dog, cup
- **Blends:** bl, cr, st, tr (black, crab, stop, tree)
- **Digraphs:** ch, sh, th, wh (chair, ship, think, whale)

## Real-Life Spelling Tips
- Read lots of books to see words spelled correctly
- Use spell check but learn the correct spelling too
- Practice writing words you use often
- Break long words into smaller parts
- Keep a personal spelling dictionary""",

## Understanding Decimals
Decimals are another way to show parts of a whole, like fractions.

## Decimal Place Values
- **Ones place:** 5.0 (the 5)
- **Tenths place:** 5.3 (the 3)
- **Hundredths place:** 5.37 (the 7)

## Real-Life Decimal Examples

### Money
- $5.25 means 5 dollars and 25 cents
- $0.50 means 50 cents (half a dollar)
- $12.99 means 12 dollars and 99 cents

### Sports
- A runner's time: 12.45 seconds
- A swimmer's time: 1.23 minutes
- Height: 5.2 feet tall

### Measurements
- Temperature: 98.6 degrees
- Distance: 3.5 miles
- Weight: 125.8 pounds

## Comparing Decimals
- 0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500 (same value)
- 0.7 > 0.65 (compare place by place)
- 0.3 < 0.30 (wait, these are equal!)

## Adding and Subtracting Decimals
Line up the decimal points:
```
  12.50
+  3.25
-------
  15.75
