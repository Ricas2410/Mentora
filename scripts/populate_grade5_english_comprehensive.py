# Reading Comprehension

## What is Reading Comprehension?
Reading comprehension is the ability to understand, remember, and think about what you read. It's not just reading the words, but understanding the meaning and message.

## Reading Strategies

### Before Reading
**Preview the Text:**
- Look at the title, headings, and pictures
- Think about what you already know about the topic
- Predict what the text might be about
- Set a purpose for reading

### During Reading
**Active Reading Strategies:**
- Ask questions as you read
- Make connections to your own life
- Visualize (create pictures in your mind)
- Make predictions about what will happen next
- Stop and summarize what you've read

### After Reading
**Reflect and Review:**
- Summarize the main ideas
- Think about what you learned
- Ask questions about confusing parts
- Connect the reading to other texts or experiences

## Types of Questions

### Literal Questions (Right There)
- Answers are directly stated in the text
- Example: "What color was the dog?"

### Inferential Questions (Think and Search)
- Answers require you to put clues together
- Example: "How do you think the character felt?"

### Critical Thinking Questions (On Your Own)
- Answers come from your own knowledge and opinions
- Example: "Do you agree with the character's decision? Why?"

## Text Features
Understanding different parts of texts helps comprehension:

### Fiction Text Features:
- **Characters:** People or animals in the story
- **Setting:** When and where the story takes place
- **Plot:** What happens in the story (beginning, middle, end)
- **Theme:** The main message or lesson

### Non-fiction Text Features:
- **Headings:** Tell you what each section is about
- **Captions:** Explain pictures and diagrams
- **Bold words:** Important vocabulary
- **Charts and graphs:** Show information visually
- **Index:** Helps you find specific topics

## Main Idea and Supporting Details

### Finding the Main Idea:
- What is the text mostly about?
- What is the most important point?
- Often found in the first or last sentence of a paragraph

### Supporting Details:
- Facts, examples, or reasons that support the main idea
- Answer questions like who, what, when, where, why, how

**Example:**
**Main Idea:** Dogs make great pets.
**Supporting Details:** 
- They are loyal and friendly
- They can be trained to follow commands
- They provide companionship and protection

## Making Connections

### Text-to-Self:
- How does this remind you of your own life?
- "This reminds me of when I..."

### Text-to-Text:
- How does this connect to other books you've read?
- "This is similar to another story because..."

### Text-to-World:
- How does this connect to the real world?
- "This reminds me of something I saw on the news..."

## Reading Different Genres

### Fiction:
- Stories that are made up
- Includes novels, short stories, fairy tales

### Non-fiction:
- True information about real people, places, events
- Includes biographies, science books, history books

### Poetry:

## Improving Reading Comprehension

### Tips for Better Understanding:
1. Read regularly (at least 20 minutes per day)
2. Choose books at your reading level
3. Discuss what you read with others
4. Keep a reading journal
5. Re-read difficult parts
6. Look up unfamiliar words
7. Take breaks when you get tired

**Many adverbs end in -ly:**
- quickly, slowly, carefully, loudly

**Examples:**

## Sentence Structure

### Complete Sentences
Every complete sentence needs:

- **My sister** (subject) **loves to read** (predicate).

### Types of Sentences

#### By Purpose:
1. **Declarative:** Makes a statement (ends with .)
   - "The sky is blue."

2. **Interrogative:** Asks a question (ends with ?)
   - "What time is it?"

3. **Imperative:** Gives a command (ends with . or !)
   - "Please close the door."

4. **Exclamatory:** Shows strong emotion (ends with !)
   - "What a beautiful day!"

#### By Structure:

## Common Grammar Mistakes

### Subject-Verb Agreement
- Singular subjects need singular verbs
- Plural subjects need plural verbs

**Correct:** The dog runs fast.
**Incorrect:** The dog run fast.

### Pronoun Usage
- Use the correct pronoun case

**Correct:** She and I went to the store.
**Incorrect:** Her and me went to the store.

### Double Negatives
- Don't use two negative words together

**Correct:** I don't have any money.
**Incorrect:** I don't have no money.
