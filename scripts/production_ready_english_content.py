## Reading Different Types of Texts

### Fiction Stories
When reading stories, focus on:
- **Characters:** Who are they? What are they like? How do they change?
- **Setting:** Where and when does the story happen?
- **Plot:** What happens? What's the main problem? How is it solved?
- **Theme:** What's the main message or lesson?

**Example:** In "Charlotte's Web," Wilbur (character) is a pig on a farm (setting) who becomes friends with a spider named Charlotte. The problem is that Wilbur might be killed, but Charlotte saves him by writing words in her web (plot). The theme is about friendship and sacrifice.

### Non-Fiction Articles
When reading informational texts:
- **Main Idea:** What is the text mostly about?
- **Supporting Details:** What facts support the main idea?
- **Text Features:** Look at headings, pictures, captions, charts
- **Author's Purpose:** Why did the author write this?

**Example:** An article about recycling might have the main idea "Recycling helps the environment." Supporting details would include facts like "Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for 3 hours."

### Poetry
When reading poems:
- **Imagery:** What pictures do the words create in your mind?
- **Rhythm:** How does the poem sound when read aloud?
- **Rhyme:** Do words at the end of lines sound alike?
- **Mood:** How does the poem make you feel?

## Advanced Reading Strategies

### Making Inferences
Sometimes authors don't tell you everything directly. You have to "read between the lines."

**Example:** "Sarah looked at her empty lunch box and sighed. Her stomach growled loudly."
*Inference:* Sarah is hungry because she finished her lunch and wants more food.

### Comparing and Contrasting
Look for similarities and differences between:
- Characters in the same story
- Different stories by the same author
- Your experiences and the characters' experiences

### Cause and Effect
Look for what happens (effect) and why it happens (cause).

**Example:** "Because it rained heavily (cause), the picnic was cancelled (effect)."

### Making Predictions
Use clues from the text to guess what might happen next.

**Example:** If a character is practicing hard for a race, you might predict they will do well in the competition.

## Real-Life Reading Applications
- **News Articles:** Understanding current events
- **Instructions:** Following directions for games, recipes, or building things
- **Social Media:** Understanding posts and comments
- **Text Messages:** Reading between the lines to understand tone
- **School Assignments:** Understanding what teachers want you to do"""

## Word Learning Strategies

### Context Clues - Advanced Techniques
1. **Definition Clues:** The word is defined in the sentence
   - "The arid desert received very little rainfall" (arid = dry)

2. **Example Clues:** Examples help explain the word
   - "Citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and limes are high in vitamin C"

3. **Contrast Clues:** Opposite words give hints
   - "Unlike his gregarious sister, Tom was quite shy" (gregarious = outgoing)

4. **Cause and Effect Clues:** One thing leads to another
   - "The medicine alleviated her pain, and she felt much better" (alleviated = reduced)

### Word Parts - Building Vocabulary
**Common Prefixes:**
- un-, dis-, mis- = not, opposite (unhappy, disagree, misunderstand)
- re-, pre-, post- = again, before, after (rewrite, preview, postpone)
- over-, under-, sub- = too much, too little, below (overeat, undercooked, submarine)

**Common Suffixes:**
- -ful, -less = with, without (helpful, careless)
- -tion, -sion = action or state (creation, decision)
- -ly, -ment = in a way, result of (quickly, agreement)

**Root Words:**
- port = carry (transport, portable, export)
- spect = see (inspect, respect, spectator)
- dict = say (predict, dictionary, dictate)

### Multiple Meanings - Context Matters
Many words have different meanings depending on how they're used:

**Bank:**
- Financial institution: "I need to go to the bank to deposit money"
- Side of a river: "We sat on the bank of the stream"
- To rely on: "You can bank on me to help you"

**Light:**
- Not heavy: "This box is light"
- Brightness: "Turn on the light"
- Not dark in color: "She wore a light blue dress"
- To ignite: "Light the candle"

### Academic Vocabulary
Words you'll see in school subjects:
- **Science:** hypothesis, experiment, observation, conclusion
- **Math:** calculate, estimate, equation, variable
- **Social Studies:** civilization, democracy, economy, culture
- **Literature:** character, setting, theme, symbolism

### Building Personal Vocabulary
1. **Keep a vocabulary journal:** Write new words and their meanings
2. **Use new words:** Try to use 3 new words each day
3. **Read widely:** Different types of books expose you to different words
4. **Play word games:** Crosswords, word searches, Scrabble
5. **Ask questions:** When you hear unfamiliar words, ask what they mean"""
