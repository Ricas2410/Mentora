# Geography and Maps

## What is Geography?
Geography is the study of Earth's surface, including land, water, air, and the distribution of life on Earth, including human life and the effects of human activity.

## Types of Maps
### Physical Maps
- Show natural features like mountains, rivers, lakes, and deserts
- Use colors: blue for water, green for low land, brown for mountains

### Political Maps
- Show countries, states, cities, and borders
- Use different colors for different countries or regions

### Climate Maps
- Show weather patterns and temperature zones
- Help us understand what the weather is like in different places

## Map Elements
Every good map has these important parts:

### 1. Title
- Tells you what the map shows
- Example: "Map of North America"

### 2. Legend (Map Key)
- Explains what symbols and colors mean
- Shows scale and measurements

### 3. Compass Rose
- Shows directions: North, South, East, West
- Helps you navigate and understand location

### 4. Scale
- Shows how distances on the map relate to real distances
- Example: 1 inch = 100 miles

## The Seven Continents
1. **Asia** - Largest continent, includes China, India, Japan
2. **Africa** - Second largest, includes Egypt, Kenya, South Africa
3. **North America** - Includes USA, Canada, Mexico
4. **South America** - Includes Brazil, Argentina, Peru
5. **Antarctica** - Coldest continent, mostly ice
6. **Europe** - Includes France, Germany, Italy
7. **Australia/Oceania** - Smallest continent

## The Five Oceans
1. **Pacific Ocean** - Largest ocean
2. **Atlantic Ocean** - Second largest
3. **Indian Ocean** - Third largest
4. **Arctic Ocean** - Smallest, very cold
5. **Southern Ocean** - Surrounds Antarctica

## Geographic Features
### Landforms:
- **Mountains:** Very high land (Example: Mount Everest)
- **Hills:** High land, smaller than mountains
- **Plains:** Flat, low land good for farming
- **Valleys:** Low land between hills or mountains
- **Plateaus:** High, flat land

### Water Features:
- **Rivers:** Moving water that flows to the sea
- **Lakes:** Bodies of water surrounded by land
- **Bays:** Parts of oceans that curve into land
- **Islands:** Land completely surrounded by water

## Using Maps in Daily Life
- Finding directions when traveling
- Understanding weather reports
- Learning about other countries
- Planning trips and adventures
- Understanding news from around the world

- Doctors and nurses (keep us healthy)
- Mail carriers (deliver mail)
- Garbage collectors (keep communities clean)
