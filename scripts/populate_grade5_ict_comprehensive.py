## What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes information and helps us with many tasks like:
- Writing documents and letters
- Playing educational games
- Watching videos and listening to music
- Communicating with friends and family
- Learning new things online

## Main Parts of a Computer

### 1. **Monitor (Screen)**
- Shows us everything the computer is doing
- Like a TV screen but for computers
- Can be flat (LCD/LED) or curved
- **Real-life example**: Just like how you watch cartoons on TV, you see your work on the computer monitor

### 2. **Keyboard**
- Has letters, numbers, and special keys
- Used for typing words and commands
- **QWERTY layout** - named after the first 6 letters
- **Real-life example**: Like a typewriter but connected to a computer

### 3. **Mouse**
- Helps us point and click on things
- Has left and right buttons
- Some have a scroll wheel in the middle
- **Real-life example**: Like using your finger to point at things, but the mouse does it on screen

### 4. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- The "brain" of the computer
- Processes all the information
- Usually inside the computer case
- **Real-life example**: Like your brain that thinks and makes decisions

### 5. **Memory (RAM)**
- Temporary storage for things the computer is working on
- More memory = computer works faster
- **Real-life example**: Like your desk where you keep books you're currently reading

### 6. **Storage (Hard Drive)**
- Permanent storage for files, photos, and programs
- Keeps information even when computer is turned off
- **Real-life example**: Like a filing cabinet where you store important papers

## Input and Output Devices

### Input Devices (Things that send information TO the computer):
- Keyboard - for typing
- Mouse - for pointing and clicking
- Microphone - for recording sound
- Camera - for taking pictures
- Scanner - for copying documents

### Output Devices (Things that show information FROM the computer):
- Monitor - shows pictures and text
- Speakers - play sounds and music
- Printer - prints documents on paper
- Headphones - for private listening

## Taking Care of Your Computer
1. **Keep it clean** - Dust the screen and keyboard regularly
2. **Handle with care** - Don't drop or hit the computer
3. **Proper shutdown** - Always turn off properly, don't just unplug
4. **Avoid food and drinks** - Keep them away from the computer
5. **Use surge protectors** - Protect from power surges

## Fun Facts About Computers
- The first computer was as big as a room!
- Modern smartphones are more powerful than computers from 30 years ago
- The word "computer" originally meant a person who did calculations
- The first computer mouse was made of wood!

Remember: Computers are tools that help us learn, create, and communicate. The more you practice, the better you'll become at using them!'''

                'content': '''# Operating Systems and Desktop

## What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is like the manager of your computer. It helps all the parts work together and lets you use different programs.

                'title': 'Creating and Organizing Files and Folders',
                'content': '''# File Management and Organization

## What are Files and Folders?

### Files
- **Documents** you create (like a school report)
- **Pictures** you take or download
- **Music** files you listen to
- **Videos** you watch
- **Programs** that run on your computer

### Folders
- **Containers** that hold files
- Like **digital filing cabinets**
- Help keep your computer organized
- Can contain other folders too!

## Real-Life Example
Think of your computer like your bedroom:
- **Files** = Individual items (books, toys, clothes)
- **Folders** = Storage containers (drawers, boxes, shelves)
- **Desktop** = Your desk surface
- **Recycle Bin** = Trash can

## Creating Files and Folders

### Creating a New Folder:
1. **Right-click** on empty space
2. Select **"New"** ‚Üí **"Folder"**
3. **Type a name** for your folder
4. Press **Enter**

### Creating a New File:
1. **Right-click** on empty space
2. Select **"New"** ‚Üí Choose file type (Document, Text file, etc.)
3. **Name your file**
4. Press **Enter**

## File Naming Best Practices
1. **Use clear names** - "Math Homework Week 1" not "homework"
2. **No special characters** - Avoid / \\ : * ? " < > |
3. **Use spaces or underscores** - "My_Project" or "My Project"
4. **Include dates** - "Science Report 2024-03-15"
5. **Keep it short** - Under 255 characters

## Organizing Your Files

### Create a Folder Structure:
```
Documents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ School Work/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Math/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Science/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ English/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ICT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Personal/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pictures/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Music/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Games/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Art Projects/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Science Fair/
```

## File Operations

### Copying Files:
1. **Right-click** the file
2. Select **"Copy"**
3. Go to destination folder
4. **Right-click** and select **"Paste"**

### Moving Files:
1. **Right-click** the file
2. Select **"Cut"**
3. Go to destination folder
4. **Right-click** and select **"Paste"**

### Deleting Files:
1. **Right-click** the file
2. Select **"Delete"**
3. File goes to **Recycle Bin**
4. **Empty Recycle Bin** to permanently delete

## Finding Lost Files

### Using Search:
1. Click **Start Menu**
2. Type the **file name**
3. Look through **search results**

### Check Common Locations:
- **Desktop** - Files saved to desktop
- **Documents** - Default save location
- **Downloads** - Files from internet
- **Recent Files** - Recently opened files

## File Extensions (File Types)
- **.txt** - Text files
- **.doc/.docx** - Word documents
- **.jpg/.png** - Picture files
- **.mp3** - Music files
- **.mp4** - Video files
- **.pdf** - PDF documents

## Safety Tips

2. **Don't delete system files** - Only delete files you created
3. **Check before deleting** - Make sure you don't need the file
4. **Use antivirus** - Protect against harmful files

## Practice Exercise
Create this folder structure on your computer:
```
My School Work/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grade 5/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Math/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Science/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ English/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ICT/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Art/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Completed/
```

Remember: Good file organization saves time and prevents lost work!'''
