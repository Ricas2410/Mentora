## Finding Good Information

### Reliable Sources
- **Books:** Written by experts and fact-checked
- **Educational websites:** .edu sites from schools and universities
- **Encyclopedias:** Both online and print versions
- **Library databases:** Specially chosen reliable sources

### Unreliable Sources
- **Social media posts:** Anyone can post anything
- **Websites without authors:** No way to check who wrote it
- **Very old information:** Facts might have changed
- **Biased sources:** Only show one side of a story

## Research Process

### 1. Choose Your Topic
- Pick something you're curious about
- Make sure it's not too broad or too narrow
- Think about what you want to learn

### 2. Ask Good Questions
- Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
- Example: "How do dolphins communicate with each other?"

### 3. Find Information
- Use multiple sources
- Take notes on important facts
- Write down where you found information

### 4. Organize Your Information
- Group similar facts together
- Put information in logical order
- Check that facts from different sources agree

## Real-Life Research Examples
- **School projects:** Learning about animals, countries, or historical events
- **Personal interests:** Finding out about hobbies, sports, or careers
- **Problem-solving:** Researching how to fix something or learn a new skill
- **Current events:** Understanding what's happening in the world

## Taking Good Notes
- Write main ideas, not every word
- Use your own words when possible
- Include the source (book title, website, etc.)
- Organize notes by topic or question"""

## Understanding Addition
Addition means combining groups or adding more to what you have.

### Real-Life Addition Examples
- **Shopping:** You buy 3 apples and 5 oranges. How many fruits total? (3 + 5 = 8)
- **Time:** You study for 25 minutes, then 15 more minutes. Total study time? (25 + 15 = 40 minutes)
- **Money:** You have $12 and earn $8 more. How much do you have now? ($12 + $8 = $20)
- **Sports:** Your team scores 14 points in the first half and 21 in the second. Total points? (14 + 21 = 35)

## Understanding Subtraction
Subtraction means taking away, finding the difference, or comparing amounts.

### Real-Life Subtraction Examples
- **Spending money:** You have $50 and spend $23. How much is left? ($50 - $23 = $27)
- **Time remaining:** It's 2:30 PM and school ends at 3:15 PM. How much time left? (45 minutes)
- **Age difference:** You are 10 years old and your sister is 7. What's the difference? (10 - 7 = 3 years)
- **Distance:** Your house is 8 miles from school and 3 miles from the store. How much farther is school? (8 - 3 = 5 miles)

## Strategies for Large Numbers

### Addition with Regrouping
```
  1,247
+   856
-------
  2,103
```
1. Add ones: 7 + 6 = 13 (write 3, carry 1)
2. Add tens: 4 + 5 + 1 = 10 (write 0, carry 1)
3. Add hundreds: 2 + 8 + 1 = 11 (write 1, carry 1)
4. Add thousands: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

### Subtraction with Regrouping
```
  1,000
-   347
-------
    653
```
When you need to borrow, regroup from the next place value.

## Mental Math Tricks
- **Adding 9:** Add 10, then subtract 1 (47 + 9 = 47 + 10 - 1 = 56)
- **Subtracting 9:** Subtract 10, then add 1 (63 - 9 = 63 - 10 + 1 = 54)
- **Adding doubles:** 25 + 25 = 50, so 25 + 26 = 51"""
