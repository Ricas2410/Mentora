## What is a Computer?

A computer is like a very smart electronic brain that can help us with many tasks. Just like how your brain has different parts that do different jobs, a computer has different parts called "components" that work together.

### Think of a Computer Like a Human Body:
- **Brain** = Processor (CPU) - thinks and makes decisions
- **Memory** = RAM - remembers things temporarily
- **Storage** = Hard Drive - stores things permanently
- **Eyes** = Monitor - shows you information
- **Hands** = Keyboard and Mouse - lets you control it

## Main Parts of a Computer

### 1. **The System Unit (The Computer's Body)**
This is the main box that contains most of the important parts:

#### **CPU (Central Processing Unit) - The Brain**
- **What it does**: Makes all the calculations and decisions
- **Real-life comparison**: Like the brain in your head
- **Fun fact**: Modern CPUs can do billions of calculations per second!
- **Example**: When you click on a program, the CPU decides what to do

#### **RAM (Random Access Memory) - Short-term Memory**
- **What it does**: Temporarily stores information the computer is currently using
- **Real-life comparison**: Like your short-term memory when doing homework
- **Why it matters**: More RAM = computer can do more things at once
- **Example**: When you open a game, it loads into RAM so it runs fast

#### **Hard Drive/SSD - Long-term Storage**
- **What it does**: Permanently stores all your files, programs, and the operating system
- **Real-life comparison**: Like a filing cabinet or your bedroom closet
- **Types**: 
  - **Hard Drive (HDD)**: Uses spinning disks (older, slower, cheaper)
  - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Uses electronic chips (newer, faster, more expensive)
- **Example**: Your photos, games, and homework are stored here

#### **Motherboard - The Highway System**
- **What it does**: Connects all the parts together
- **Real-life comparison**: Like the roads that connect different parts of a city
- **Important**: Everything plugs into the motherboard

#### **Power Supply - The Heart**
- **What it does**: Provides electricity to all parts
- **Real-life comparison**: Like your heart pumping blood to your body
- **Safety note**: Never open the power supply - it can be dangerous!

2. **Support the victim** - Send them a kind private message
3. **Report the bullying** - To the website and adults
4. **Tell a trusted adult** - They can help stop it

## Building Digital Empathy

### Understanding Others Online

#### **Remember:**
- **Everyone has feelings** - Even if you can't see them
- **Words can hurt** - Just like in real life
- **Cultural differences** - People from different places have different customs
- **Language barriers** - Not everyone speaks English as their first language

#### **How to Show Empathy:**
- **Ask yourself**: "How would I feel if someone said this to me?"
- **Be patient** - With people who don't understand technology as well
- **Offer help** - When someone is struggling online
- **Celebrate others** - Congratulate people on their achievements

Remember: The internet is an amazing tool for learning, creating, and connecting with others. By being safe, respectful, and kind online, you help make the internet a better place for everyone!'''
