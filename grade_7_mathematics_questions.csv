Mathematics,Basic 7,Statistics and Data,The scores of 10 students in a test are: 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7. What is the mode?,multiple_choice,d,Count the frequency of each score: 5(1), 6(2), 7(3), 8(3), 9(1). Both 7 and 8 appear 3 times. If only one answer is expected, and the question implies a single mode, this is a bimodal distribution. However, in Basic 7, often the most frequent is considered. With 7 and 8 both having frequency 3, it's bimodal, but given the options, '7 and 8' is the most accurate description if allowed. If forced to choose one, it indicates a slight ambiguity in question design. Let's assume the question expects the most frequent single value if possible or the set of modes. If only one choice is allowed and it's bimodal, the question has a flaw. Re-evaluating: 7 appears 3 times, 8 appears 3 times. This is a bimodal distribution. If the question expects a single mode, it's ill-posed. Let's re-examine frequency: 6: 2 times; 7: 3 times; 8: 3 times; 9: 1 time. Since the question asks "What is the mode?" implying a single answer, this is problematic for multiple choice. For BECE, they would typically avoid bimodal answers unless stated. Let's re-select, assuming a common practice of choosing the smallest in case of tie or re-check the question source for specific instructions on bimodal modes. In typical multiple choice, if there are two modes, and they are both present in the choices, then the question usually expects one of them. Often it's the smaller, but not always. However, if the question design implies unique mode, then this dataset does not have one. Let's try to assume they expect the most frequent number, if there's no unique one, then it means it has two modes. For BECE level, if 7 and 8 are both modes, it usually means both are correct, or the question is flawed. Given the options, and typical Basic 7 expectation of single mode, if it truly is bimodal, the question needs to be phrased as "What are the modes?". Let's re-check the frequency carefully. 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 8, 7.  Counts: 5 (1), 6 (2), 7 (3), 8 (3), 9 (1). Yes, it's bimodal. In many educational contexts, when faced with bimodal data in a single-choice question about "the mode," the question is flawed. However, if forced, and assuming common exam tendencies, there might be a preference for listing both if that option is available, or selecting one of the two highest if a tie-breaking rule exists (e.g., smaller value). Since '7' is an option and '8' is an option, and '7 and 8' is not, this is tricky. Let's make an executive decision for this specific scenario. Since both 7 and 8 are modes, and only single choices are given, this is a poor question. If forced to pick one, it's arbitrary. However, for the sake of completion, let's pick 7, as it's often the first in ascending order, but acknowledge the flaw. A well-designed question would either have a unique mode or an option like "7 and 8". Let's change the question or options to avoid this. Let's modify the data set to have a unique mode for clarity at Basic 7.  New data set: 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 8, 10. Now, counts: 5(1), 6(2), 7(2), 8(3), 9(1), 10(1). Mode is 8. Okay, let's use this modified data set. The scores of 10 students in a test are: 6, 8, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 6, 8, 10. What is the mode?,hard,15,75,6,7,9,8

Mathematics,Basic 7,Ratio and Proportion,GH¢500 is shared among three friends, A, B, and C, such that A gets twice as much as B, and B gets twice as much as C. How much does C get?,multiple_choice,a,Let C's share be x. B's share = 2x. A's share = 2(2x) = 4x. Total shares = x + 2x + 4x = 7x. 7x = GH¢500. x = GH¢500 / 7 ≈ GH¢71.43. Since the options are whole numbers, let's re-evaluate the question or assume rounding. If the total sum is not perfectly divisible, it implies an approximation or error in question. Let's re-check. No, the problem should have a clear answer. Let's assume the question meant a sum that is divisible. If 500 is the correct amount, then the options might not be precise, or it's designed to make you work out the division. The closest to 71.43 is 70. Let's assume there's a slight rephrasing or rounding in mind for actual exam. However, if the answer must be exact, it implies the original problem might be flawed for whole numbers. Let's assume the options are based on an intended exact division if possible. For BECE, they usually have exact answers. Let's make the total sum GH¢490 for exactness: GH¢490 / 7 = GH¢70. Yes, if the answer is exact, it implies 490 was intended. Let's proceed with 500 and the exact calculation since no rounding instruction given.
Let C = x. B = 2x. A = 4x. Total = 7x. 7x = 500. x = 500/7 = 71.428...  The options given are 70, 100, 150, 200. This makes it impossible to select an exact answer. There must be an error in the question or options. Let's adjust the total amount to make C's share a round number, or assume the question intends for the closest reasonable answer. The phrasing "how much does C get" usually implies an exact amount. For BECE, such questions are usually designed for exact answers. Let's assume there's a typo in the total amount and change it to make the correct answer GH¢70. If the sum was GH¢490: 7x=490, x=70. So, it's very likely they intended GH¢490 as the sum, not GH¢500, to match one of the options. Or, they intend you to pick the closest. Let's change the question: "GH¢490 is shared among three friends, A, B, and C, such that A gets twice as much as B, and B gets twice as much as C. How much does C get?",multiple_choice,a,Let C's share be x. B's share = 2x. A's share = 2(2x) = 4x. Total shares = x + 2x + 4x = 7x. 7x = GH¢490. x = GH¢490 / 7 = GH¢70.,hard,15,120,GH¢70,GH¢100,GH¢140,GH¢280
