## Understanding Email

### What is Email?
Email (Electronic Mail) is like sending letters through the computer instead of the post office. It's a way to send messages, pictures, and files to people anywhere in the world instantly!

### Real-Life Comparison:
- **Traditional mail**: Write letter ‚Üí Put in envelope ‚Üí Mail to post office ‚Üí Delivered in days
- **Email**: Type message ‚Üí Click send ‚Üí Delivered in seconds!

### Parts of an Email Address:
**Example**: sarah.student@school.edu

- **Username**: sarah.student (identifies the person)
- **@ symbol**: Separates username from domain
- **Domain**: school.edu (identifies the email provider/organization)

### Common Email Providers:
- **Gmail**: @gmail.com (Google's email service)
- **Outlook**: @outlook.com (Microsoft's email service)
- **Yahoo**: @yahoo.com (Yahoo's email service)
- **School emails**: Often end with .edu
- **Work emails**: Usually company name like @company.com

## Parts of an Email

### Email Interface Components:

#### **Inbox:**
- **What it is**: Where you receive new emails
- **Like**: Your mailbox at home
- **Organization**: Usually shows newest emails first

#### **Compose/New Email:**
- **What it does**: Creates a new email to send
- **Button location**: Usually says "Compose" or "New"
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Often Ctrl + N

#### **Sent Items:**
- **What it contains**: Copies of emails you've sent
- **Why useful**: Proof you sent something, reference for follow-up

#### **Drafts:**
- **What it stores**: Emails you started but haven't sent yet
- **When to use**: When you need time to think about your message
- **Auto-save**: Most email programs save drafts automatically

#### **Trash/Deleted Items:**
- **What it holds**: Emails you've deleted
- **Recovery**: You can usually get emails back from here
- **Permanent deletion**: Trash is usually emptied automatically after 30 days

### Writing an Email:

#### **Essential Fields:**
- **To**: Email address of the person you're sending to
- **Subject**: Brief description of what your email is about
- **Message body**: Your actual message

#### **Optional Fields:**
- **CC (Carbon Copy)**: Send a copy to someone else
- **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)**: Send a secret copy (others can't see who got BCC)
- **Attachments**: Files you want to include

## Email Etiquette and Best Practices

### Writing Professional Emails:

#### **Subject Lines:**
- **Be specific**: "Math homework question" not "Question"
- **Keep it short**: Aim for 5-8 words
- **Good examples**:
  - "Grade 5 Science Project Due Date"
  - "Permission slip for field trip"

## Email Safety and Security

### Protecting Your Email Account:

#### **Strong Passwords:**
- **Use 8+ characters**: Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Don't use personal info**: No birthdays, pet names, or addresses
- **Unique passwords**: Different password for email than other accounts
- **Example**: "MyEmail2024!" (but create your own!)

#### **Two-Factor Authentication:**
- **What it is**: Extra security step after password
- **How it works**: Enter password + code from phone
- **Why important**: Even if someone knows your password, they can't get in
- **Ask an adult**: To help you set this up

### Recognizing Spam and Phishing:

#### **Spam Emails (Junk Mail):**
- **What they are**: Unwanted emails trying to sell things
- **Common signs**: 
  - "You've won a million dollars!"
  - Lots of spelling mistakes
  - Asking for money or personal information
  - From unknown senders

#### **Phishing Emails (Fake Emails):**
- **What they are**: Fake emails pretending to be from real companies
- **Goal**: Steal your passwords or personal information
- **Warning signs**:
  - "Your account will be closed unless you click here"
  - Asking for passwords or personal information
  - Links that don't match the real website
  - Urgent language: "Act now!" "Limited time!"

#### **What to Do:**
1. **Don't click links** in suspicious emails
2. **Don't download attachments** from unknown senders
3. **Don't reply** to spam emails
4. **Tell an adult** if you're unsure about an email
5. **Mark as spam** to help your email filter learn

## Digital Communication Beyond Email

## What is Programming?

### Understanding Programming:
Programming is like giving instructions to a computer. Just like you might give directions to a friend to get to your house, programming is giving step-by-step directions to a computer to solve problems or create cool things!

### Real-Life Comparison:
- **Recipe**: Step-by-step instructions to make cookies
- **LEGO instructions**: Step-by-step guide to build a castle
- **Programming**: Step-by-step instructions for a computer to create a game

### What Can You Create with Programming?
- **Games**: Like Minecraft, Roblox, or mobile games
- **Websites**: Like YouTube, Google, or your school website
- **Apps**: Like calculator, weather, or drawing apps
- **Robots**: Programming robots to move, dance, or solve puzzles
- **Art**: Creating digital art, animations, and music

## Basic Programming Concepts

### 1. **Algorithms (Step-by-Step Instructions)**

An algorithm is just a fancy word for a list of steps to solve a problem.

#### **Example Algorithm: Making a Peanut Butter Sandwich**
1. Get two slices of bread
2. Open the peanut butter jar
3. Get a knife
4. Put peanut butter on one slice
5. Put the slices together
6. Enjoy your sandwich!

#### **Programming Algorithm: Drawing a Square**
1. Move forward 100 steps
2. Turn right 90 degrees
3. Move forward 100 steps
4. Turn right 90 degrees
5. Move forward 100 steps
6. Turn right 90 degrees
7. Move forward 100 steps
8. Turn right 90 degrees

### 2. **Sequences (Doing Things in Order)**

In programming, the order of instructions matters! Just like getting dressed, you put on socks before shoes.

#### **Good Sequence:**
1. Put on socks
2. Put on shoes
3. Tie shoelaces

#### **Bad Sequence:**
1. Put on shoes
2. Put on socks ‚Üê This won't work!
3. Tie shoelaces

### 3. **Loops (Repeating Actions)**

Loops help us repeat actions without writing the same instruction over and over.

#### **Real-Life Loop Example:**
Instead of writing "Brush your teeth" 365 times for a year, we can say:
"Every day for 365 days: Brush your teeth"

#### **Programming Loop Example:**
Instead of writing "Move forward" 10 times, we can say:
"Repeat 10 times: Move forward"

### 4. **Conditions (Making Decisions)**

Conditions help computers make decisions based on different situations.

#### **Real-Life Condition:**
"IF it's raining, THEN take an umbrella, ELSE wear sunglasses"

#### **Programming Condition:**
"IF the character touches a wall, THEN turn around, ELSE keep moving"

### 5. **Variables (Storing Information)**

Variables are like boxes that store information we want to remember and use later.

#### **Real-Life Variables:**
- **Name box**: Contains "Sarah"
- **Age box**: Contains "10"
- **Favorite color box**: Contains "Blue"

#### **Programming Variables:**
- **Score**: Contains "150"
- **Player name**: Contains "SuperGamer"
- **Lives remaining**: Contains "3"

## Introduction to Scratch Programming

### Getting Started with Scratch:

#### **1. The Scratch Interface:**
- **Stage**: Where your characters perform
- **Sprites**: Characters or objects in your program
- **Blocks**: Puzzle pieces that create instructions
- **Scripts**: Connected blocks that make programs

#### **2. Types of Blocks:**
- **Motion blocks** (blue): Make sprites move
- **Looks blocks** (purple): Change appearance
- **Sound blocks** (pink): Add music and sound effects
- **Events blocks** (yellow): Start programs when something happens
- **Control blocks** (orange): Loops and conditions
- **Sensing blocks** (light blue): Detect what's happening

### Simple Scratch Projects:

#### **Project 1: Moving Cat**
1. Use "when green flag clicked" block
2. Add "move 10 steps" block
3. Add "if on edge, bounce" block
4. Add "forever" loop around the movement blocks
5. Click the green flag to see your cat move!

#### **Project 2: Color-Changing Sprite**
1. Use "when green flag clicked" block
2. Add "forever" loop
3. Inside the loop, add "change color effect by 25"
4. Add "wait 1 seconds"
5. Watch your sprite change colors!

#### **Project 3: Simple Game**
1. Create a sprite that follows your mouse
2. Create another sprite that moves randomly
3. Use "if touching" block to detect when they meet
4. Add sound effects and score counting

## Problem-Solving with Programming

### Breaking Down Big Problems:

#### **The Programming Process:**
1. **Understand the problem**: What do you want to create?
2. **Break it into smaller parts**: What are the main features?
3. **Plan your solution**: What steps are needed?
4. **Code one part at a time**: Start with the simplest part
5. **Test and debug**: Fix any problems
6. **Add more features**: Build on what works

#### **Example: Creating a Simple Game**
1. **Big problem**: "I want to make a game"
2. **Smaller parts**:
   - Character that moves
   - Objects to collect
   - Score counter
   - Game over condition
3. **Start simple**: Just make the character move
4. **Add features**: One at a time

### Debugging (Fixing Problems):

#### **Common Programming Problems:**
- **Sprite not moving**: Check if movement blocks are connected
- **Sound not playing**: Make sure sound blocks are in the right place
- **Game not starting**: Check if you have "when green flag clicked"
- **Unexpected behavior**: Read through your code step by step

#### **Debugging Tips:**
1. **Read your code carefully**: Does it say what you want?
2. **Test small parts**: Make sure each piece works
3. **Ask for help**: Programming is teamwork!
4. **Try different solutions**: There's usually more than one way
5. **Don't give up**: Every programmer faces problems!
