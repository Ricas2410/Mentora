# üìß Email Verification Setup Guide for Mentora

## üîß Current Status
Your Mentora platform is currently configured to print emails to the console (development mode). This means when users register, the verification email will appear in your terminal/console instead of being sent to their actual email address.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: Development Mode (Current - Console Emails)
**Best for:** Testing and development
**Current setting in .env:**
```
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
```

**How it works:**
- When users register, they see: "Account created successfully! Check the console/terminal for your verification email (development mode)."
- The verification email appears in your terminal where you run `python manage.py runserver`
- You can copy the verification link from the console and test it

### Option 2: Production Mode (Real Emails via Gmail)
**Best for:** Live deployment on PythonAnywhere
**Required changes in .env:**

```env
# Change this line:
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend

# Add your Gmail credentials:
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

```

### Manual Test

2. Check the appropriate location for the verification email:
   - **Console mode:** Check your terminal/console output
   - **Gmail mode:** Check your email inbox (including spam folder)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Authentication failed" error:**
- Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- Verify 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Google account

**2. "SMTPAuthenticationError":**
- Double-check your EMAIL_HOST_USER (should be your full Gmail address)
- Verify your App Password is correct (16 characters with spaces)

**3. Emails going to spam:**
- This is normal for new sending domains
- Ask users to check their spam folder
- Consider using a professional email service for production

**4. "Connection refused" error:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT settings
- Make sure EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

### Debug Steps:
1. Check your `.env` file settings
2. Restart your Django server after making changes
3. Look at the console output for error messages
4. Test with the provided script: `python scripts/setup_email_system.py`
